# ED6 Test

Tasks to accomplish in order of priority. Finish what you are able in the time allotted.

### Requirements
- NPM
- Photoshop

if you want to use gulp to compile scss to css, run `npm install` from the root of the project. Once the npm packages are installed, you can run `gulp` to watch and compile the scss files to css.
### Recreate the Design
Using the GetEDealer-SEM-1240.psd or jpg as reference, recreate the design in html and css. 
For this task you can exclude the headers and footers. Only implement the content in the white section.
You can also skip the contact form at the bottom for this section.

### Make it Responsive
Using the GetEDealer-SEM-320.psd or jpg as reference, now make the design from the previous task responsive
as the viewport shrinks.

### Add the Contact Form
Now add the contact form from the designs. Like the previous sections, this should display correctly on 
Desktop and Mobile.
